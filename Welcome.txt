Hi Folks,

Welcome to the GitHub repo I have set up for our Web Dev I course. We will use this repository for some of our current assignments and also to distribute code starter packs for later assignments. Code starter packs contain premade code (sometimes called skeletons) that you will need to modify or extend as part of an assignment. 

You have been given a codeword via email to use as your personal identifier. That is because this repo is public and I would prefer to not have your personal information sitting somewhere on the Internet. That said, please do your best to not use any personnally identifiable information like real names, student numbers, addresses, etc. in these assignments.

By the way, I have made revisions to this file... you can check the history to see what those changes are :)

Welcome again!
